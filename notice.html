    <p>NOTICE WRITING</p>
        <p>1. At first for Notice writing, we have to start by this line:</p>
        <p><b>“It’s hereby informed/ notified that ………… (Notice subject)” (for Club purposes)</b> </p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p><b>“The students are hereby informed/members of our school/club are informed that ………. (Notice subject)” (for School/College purposes) </b> </p>
        <p>2. Then we have to write the body of the subject in short form.</p>
        <p>3. At the end, we have to write:</p>
        <p><b> “For further/more information/details contact the undersigned person/ One may contact the undersigned for mor/further details”</b></p>
