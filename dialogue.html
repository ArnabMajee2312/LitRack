    <p>DIALOGUE WRITING</p>
    <p> The conversation between two or more people is called Dialogue.</p>
        <p>1. At first, we have to start conversation by saying “Hi/ Hello!”</p>
        <p>2. We have to talk some other subject then move to the main topic.</p>
        <p>3. We have to use short/contracted form in the conversation.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><b> I am = I’m, I have = I’ve, He cannot = He can’t, etc.</b></p>
        <p>4. We have to finish conversation by saying “I’ve to go now. See you later. Nice to meet you. Good Bye”</p>
