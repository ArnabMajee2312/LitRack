    <h1>STORY</h1>
    <p>STORY WRITING</p>
        <p>1. First, we have to write the story name in capital form. (Mainly, the main character of the story or the moral of the story is written as Title)</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p><b>THE CROW AND THE FOX (character wise name)
            Grasp all, lose all (Moral wise name)</b> </p>
        <p>2. Secondly, we have to start writing by this format: </p>
        <p>3. Once/Once upon a time/ One day – subject – 2nd form of Verb - object</p>
        <p>4. Before writing, we have to read all the related point to write a story.</p>
        <p>5. Then, we have to make sentence serially according to the point in Past Tense.</p>
        <p>6. We have to add many extra sentences to connect one point to another to maintain succession.</p>
        <p>7. We have to remember that while writing the story, the points shouldn’t be in disorder.</p>
        <p>8. We have to write one or two sentences in direct speech.</p> 
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><b> The Crow said to the Fox, “I know what you want.”</b></p>
        <p>9. At last, we must have to write a Moral sentence.</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p><b>“Tit for Tat”/ “Look before you Leap”, etc.</b></p>
