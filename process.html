    <p>PROCESS WRITING</p>
    <p> When something is made or done, we have to write about the process of making or doing that thing. This is called Process.</p>
        <p>1. At first, we have to add a Title.</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p><b>HOW TEA IS PREPARED/TEA PREPARATION/THE MAKING OF TEA</b> </p>
        <p>2. Secondly, we have to write about the advantages of the product.</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p><b>Tea is a popular drink which makes us refresh.</b> </p>
        <p>3. We have to write every sentence in Common Tense.</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p><b>Example: It’s prepared/proposed/made/completed through some stages/steps.</b> </p>
        <p>4. Next, we have to start writing by this word <b>“At first”/ “First”</b>.</p>
        <p>5. Then, we have to write sentences by this format:
            <b>Linker – Object – is/are – 3rd form of Verb – Other</b>.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><b> At first, Water is taken in a pot.</b></p>
        <p>6. Some linkers have to add with every sentence. These are: <b>“Then, Next, Later, After that, Thereafter, Now, etc.”</b></p>
        <p><b>*We can’t use same linker in case of consecutive sentences.</b></p>
        <p>7. We have to write “Finally” at the last sentence of the process.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><b> Finally Tea is ready to be served.</b></p>
